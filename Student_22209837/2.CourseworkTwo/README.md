# Sathin Smakkamai 22209837
## Introduction
To integrate collected data into the decision-making process, we need to establish a data pipeline that connects to the data source, transforms and manipulates it, and ultimately stores the processed data in organized environments. 

For the Quantitative Finance coursework 2, focusing on Big Data, we will devise a data pipeline tailored for the trading team. This pipeline will involve loading a batch trade file (formatted as a parquet file), performing transformations, analyzing the data to detect trade validity, and storing the analysis results, trading records, and portfolio positions in the selected database (SQLite).
